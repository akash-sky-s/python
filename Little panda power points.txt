Little Panda has a thing for powers and modulus and he likes challenges. His friend** Lucy**, however, is impractical and challenges Panda to find both positive and negative powers of a number modulo a particular number. We all know thatimagerefers to the modular inverse ofimage(see Wikipedia).

Since Lucy is impractical, she says thatimageforimage.

Now she wants Panda to computeimage.

She also thinks that this problem can be very difficult if the constraints aren't given properly.** Little Panda** is very confused and leaves the problem to the worthy programmers of the world. Help him in finding the solution.
